Coordinated Gene Activity in Pattern Sets (CoGAPS, https://github.com/FertigLab/CoGAPS) implements a Bayesian MCMC matrix factorization algorithm, 
GAPS, and links it to gene set statistic methods to infer biological process activity. It can be used to perform sparse matrix 
factorization on any data, and when this data represents biomolecules, to do gene set analysis.

This repository packages CoGAPS as a docker container and also provides a GenePattern module wrapper for running 
CoGAPS   as a GenePattern module.
